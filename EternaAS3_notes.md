Notes

* Entry point: `Eterna.initialize_game()`
* `GameObject`: root object
    - `GameAnimator` functions similarly to tasks
* `PoseEdit`
* `GameMode`: GameObject wrapper

Questions:

* IRC chat? (we don’t have proper sockets on the web - would have to set up a relay server) (https://github.com/elementalalchemist/txircd)
* EternaScript? Is this the same as RScript?
* Solving for eval() of javascript feels like a separate project
* Help set up milestones? I don’t know everything there is to know.
* Unit tests or other methods of evaluating things like “RNAInverse” and the various Folders?
